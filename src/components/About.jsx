            <p>This site was built by Seth Feldman. 
                It was built as a tool for me (Seth) and 
                his friends to use in order to track
                stats for their adult hockey league.  

                This was built using a number of libraries 
                including MUI, React, React Router, and it uses Firebase 
                for its backend. 
            </p>
